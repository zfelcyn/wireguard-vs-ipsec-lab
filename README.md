# wireguard-vs-ipsec-lab
Our project sets up and analyzes a secure site-to-site VPN tunnel using WireGuard, evaluating its performance, scalability, and security compared to traditional protocols like IPsec. Through testing and automation, we aim to demonstrate WireGuardâ€™s advantages in simplicity, efficiency, and modern cryptographic design.
